# React + TypeScript + Vite

========
React
ReactJS has solidified itself as a cornerstone in contemporary web development. With its declarative approach and component-based structure, React streamlines the creation of interactive user interfaces. Its relevance in the present landscape is unmistakable, providing developers with an efficient tool to manage complex UI logic and seamlessly update the view when the underlying data changes.

In an age where user experience is paramount, React's virtual DOM ensures optimal performance, enhancing the responsiveness of web applications. Its popularity lies not just in its capabilities but in its ability to simplify the development process, allowing teams to build scalable and maintainable applications. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of web technologies, ReactJS remains a stalwart, offering a reliable and structured foundation for modern web development practices

2048
Welcome to the intriguing realm of 2048, a game that blends numbers and strategy into a captivating puzzle. In this 4x4 grid, you navigate tiles with powers of two, aiming to combine them strategically and reach the coveted 2048 tile.

The mechanics are simple yet offer a profound challenge. You slide tiles across the board, merging identical ones to create larger numbers. The objective is to continue this process until you reach the elusive 2048 tile, demonstrating your mastery over the numerical cascade.

However, the game introduces an element of unpredictability. With each move, a new tile appears, introducing an element of randomness that demands careful planning and adaptability. Success hinges on your ability to balance strategic thinking with the ever-evolving board.

So, step into the world of 2048, where numbers and logic intertwine in a quietly absorbing puzzle. It's a journey that invites contemplation and rewards thoughtful maneuvering. Will you unravel the mysteries of the grid, or will the numbers prove to be an enigmatic challenge? The answers lie in your strategic choices as you navigate this numerical landscape

MCTS
The pure version of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) involves a simplified process without some enhancements like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In its basic form, MCTS follows these steps:

Selection: Start at the root of the tree and recursively select nodes until a leaf node is reached. The selection can be random or based on a simple policy.

Expansion: If the selected node hasn't been fully expanded (i.e., there are unexplored moves from that state), expand it by adding a child node corresponding to an unexplored move.

Simulation (Rollout): Conduct a simulation (also known as a rollout or playout) from the newly added node or the previously existing one. This involves making random moves or using a simple heuristic until a terminal state is reached.

Backpropagation: Update the statistics of all nodes traversed during the selection and expansion steps. This involves incrementing visit counts and adjusting the cumulative value based on the outcome of the simulation.

Repeat these steps for a specified number of iterations or until a time limit is reached. The final move is typically chosen based on the statistics gathered at the root node.

The pure version of MCTS doesn't incorporate heuristics like UCB, making it more straightforward but potentially less efficient in balancing exploration and exploitation. It serves as a foundational framework upon which various enhancements can be applied to tailor the algorithm to specific problems.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
